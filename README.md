# NBA Draft Combine Measurement Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes NBA Draft Combine data, focusing on key physical measurements such as height, weight, and wingspan. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that might predict player success based on these metrics.

## Contents
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Python code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Excel File**: Raw dataset containing NBA Draft Combine measurements.

## Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Height and weight conversions (feet/inches to cm and pounds to kg).
   - Ensured consistency and filled any missing data.

2. **Descriptive Analysis**:
   - Summary statistics for each player position (e.g., PG, SF, C).
   - Visualized key metrics using boxplots and histograms to identify distribution patterns.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Explored relationships between physical measurements (e.g., height vs. wingspan).
   - Calculated correlations to identify significant trends related to player performance.

4. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Detected outliers in weight and height distributions, particularly in guard and forward positions.

5. **Visualizations**:
   - Scatter plots, boxplots, and pie charts highlight trends and recommendations for draft strategy.

## Tools
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**
- **Google Colab**
- **Excel** for initial data setup
